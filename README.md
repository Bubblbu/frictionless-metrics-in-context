# Metrics in Context

> What is the value of a measurement if we don't know anything about the tool used to take the measurement?

Metrics in Context is an exploration of scholarly metrics and their becoming. How do the h-index, citation counts on Google Scholar, or number of shares and tweets come about as the entities that we use to assess articles, researchers, institutions, and even countries?  

## Introduction

This project entails three major components which I am tackling quite independently as the first one addresses conceptual questions around the processes and procedures that lead to what we consider metrics. The second part concerns the implementation of that framework in Frictionless in the form of a dedicated [data package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/). Finally, we will give it a test run with some real data coming from work conducted at the [ScholCommLab](https://scholcommlab.ca).

- *Phase 1*: Creation of an analytic framework to talk about the provenance of scholarly metrics 
- *Phase 2*: Prototype of a Frictionless Data Package in order to describe, verify, and transform metrics datasets
- *Phase 3*: Testing with real data

You can find a (messy) roadmap [here](https://github.com/Bubblbu/metrics-in-context/issues/2) where I am trying to keep a timeline, milestones, and goals in sight using Github Issues. I will try to document insights and progress in this pinned issue and keep corresponding issues for sub-tasks updated.

## The Processes of Metrics (aka my PhD stuff)

The first part of this project has major overlaps with my doctoral research which is why I am shamelessly plugging it here and providing some more details.

In my PhD, I am questioning the taken-for-granted nature of citation data and other scholarly metrics. It is difficult to capture the full impact of citations and metrics derived from citational data as they basically shape every aspect and area of scholarship from hiring and promotion guidelines, over assessment of research(ers), to funding decisions.

I also want to specifically thank Lilly Winfreed for being patient with me during a global pandemic and providing guidance and input on my usually messy thoughts and ideas.
