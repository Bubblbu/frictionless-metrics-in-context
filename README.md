# Metrics in Context

Metrics in Context is a Frictionless Tool Fund project that explores the question of packaging and delivering scholarly metrics with their provenance information within one data structure.

*Scholarly metrics* are considered to be citation counts, indicators derived from citations, access and download counts, or social media shares for scholarly articles. *Provenance* refers to metadata for a record that details its origin and how it came about in its final form.

In this project, the focus was on the citation as a metric and exploring ways to combine it with its provenance information including.

## Development

You can find a (messy) roadmap [here](https://github.com/Bubblbu/metrics-in-context/issues/2) where I am trying to keep a timeline, milestones, and goals in sight using Github Issues. I will try to document insights and progress in this pinned issue and keep corresponding issues for sub-tasks updated.

### Proof of Concept

A proof of concept is presented in this [notebook](https://github.com/Bubblbu/metrics-in-context/blob/master/prototypes/1_scite/prototype_1_scite.ipynb)

### Related research

In [this paper](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/qss_a_00044) we proposed an alternative method to collect the number of times a scholarly article was shared on Facebook. While this paper focusses on the technical challenges and implications of this new method, the underlying concerns have already been the same ones that are addressed by this project.
