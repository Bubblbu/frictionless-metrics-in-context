    "This notebook presents a proof of concept for a standardized approach to citation data and, more broadly, scholarly metrics. To do so, we will take a bibliometric dataset consisting of four spreadsheets and build a Frictionless [Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/) using a systematic approach to describe each tables provenance. I will first introduce the dataset at hand and provide an quick overview and situate it in the context of traditional bibliometric work. Then, I will step-by-step introduce a new conceptual framework for scholarly metrics and gradually incorporate the dataset into the final data package. Finally, a few concluding remarks and a brief discussion of the potential and limitations of this approach.\n",

The particular sample was created by querying for recent articles in Pubmed on Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Scite is one of the newer data sources that not only provide the classic citation link between two documents, but attempt to extract what has been established as citation contexts. While the former can be understood as the datafication of bibliographies and reference lists, context-aware citations trace each individual in-text mention of articles.\n",

This framework is part of a broader doctoral research project and is built around the philosophical shift from object-centrism to process-centrism. This shift from representation towards performance can also be expressed for scholarly metrics by emphasising the processes and practices that lead to outputs and citation counts. But how do these processes look like and how can we start to systematically describe them?\n",

This state is then captured by a *citation link* in their databases. This data then enables the creation of *citation metrics*. I would like to retell this story equipped with a new vocabulary for provenance and while paying attention to each step in the individuation of the citation count.  "

    "\n",
    "Firstly, I propose to question the idea of the citation as one consistent concept itself. It is typically understood as a directional binary property between two peer-reviewed research articles. However, more and more citation databases are using text-processing methods to extract the individual in-text mentions with their contexts and furthermore the types of documents hosting citations is changing (e.g., datasets, software, mentions in social media). To accomodate for these changes, I suggest to think in terms of *citational events* and their *contexts*."

    "The typical citation is a statement in a peer-reviewed scholarly article referencing another piece of scholarly writing. Some of the new social (and technical) challenges around citations stem from changing citational practices such as the citing of preprints or datasets. So far, these changes have been pragmatically addressed by introduction of norms and dedicated infrastructure (e.g., the push for DOIs for datasets and iniatives that track their usage) but we are lacking the conceptual language to capture all these forms of citations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid falling into the trap of never-ending definitions, I propose to re-conceptualize the citation as an interdiscursive event (Nakassis, 2013) which links two discursive acts. For the present purpose it will suffice to understand *discursive acts* as some form of written or spoken statement. Modality, syntax, and even semantics become part of the wider context of that particular citational event. I've talked enough about things that bald French men usually talk about, thus, without further ado, let's dive into implementing said citational event:"
